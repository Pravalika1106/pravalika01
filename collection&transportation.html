                <h2>Collecting and transporting</h2><br>
                <p>Proper solid-waste collection is important for the protection of public health, safety, and environmental quality. It is a labour-intensive activity, accounting for approximately three-quarters of the total cost of solid-waste management. Public employees are often assigned to the task, but sometimes it is more economical for private companies to do the work under contract to the municipality or for private collectors to be paid by individual home owners. A driver and one or two loaders serve each collection vehicle. These are typically trucks of the enclosed, compacting type, with capacities up to 30 cubic metres (40 cubic yards). Loading can be done from the front, rear, or side. Compaction reduces the volume of refuse in the truck to less than half of its loose volume.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The task of selecting an optimal collection route is a complex problem, especially for large and densely populated cities. An optimal route is one that results in the most efficient use of labour and equipment, and selecting such a route requires the application of computer analyses that account for all the many design variables in a large and complex network. Variables include frequency of collection, haulage distance, type of service, and climate. Collection of refuse in rural areas can present a special problem, since the population densities are low, leading to high unit costs.</p>                 
                <br>
                <p>Refuse collection usually occurs at least once per week because of the rapid decomposition of food waste. The amount of garbage in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/refuse">refuse</a> of an individual home can be reduced by garbage grinders, or garbage disposals. Ground garbage puts an extra load on sewerage systems, but this can usually be accommodated. Many communities now conduct source separation and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/recycling">recycling</a> programs, in which homeowners and businesses separate recyclable materials from garbage and place them in separate containers for collection. In addition, some communities have drop-off centres where residents can bring recyclables.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inadequate Infrastructure: </strong>Lack of proper roads, collection vehicles, and waste processing facilities.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Financial Constraints: </strong>Limited budgets for waste management services.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Public Awareness: </strong>Poor understanding of waste segregation and disposal.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Illegal Dumping: </strong>Unauthorized dumping of waste in public spaces.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Seasonal Variations: </strong>Increased waste generation during festivals and holidays.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Geographical Challenges: </strong>Difficult terrain and remote areas.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Operational Inefficiencies: </strong>Poor planning and coordination of collection and transportation services.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Corruption and Bribery: </strong>Compromising the efficiency and effectiveness of waste management.</li>

                <h2>Sustainable waste management</h2><br>
                <p>Sustainable waste management is a set of practices that aim to reduce the environmental impact of waste by minimizing production, reusing and recycling materials, and ensuring safe disposal. The goal is to conserve natural resources, create economic and social benefits, and reduce pollution.</p>
                <p>Here are some sustainable waste management practices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reduce, reuse, recycle:</strong> Use things with care to reduce the amount of waste you generate. Use items or parts of items again if they still have usable aspects. Use waste itself as a resource.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Composting: </strong>A sustainable way to manage biodegradable organic waste. Composting stabilizes organic waste and makes it safe to reuse. </li><br>
                    <li><strong>Waste to energy: </strong>An efficient and sustainable waste treatment method that produces heat to generate electricity. Waste to energy plants can reduce waste by up to 96%.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Circular economy: </strong>A sustainability trend that aims to eliminate waste and promote continuous use of resources.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Waste prevention: </strong>A top priority strategy for sustainable development that reduces the amount of waste generated and the adverse impact associated with waste. </li><br>
                    <li><strong>Donate: </strong>An alternative to throwing away extra items. Donating can benefit the recipient and you may also receive tax incentives. </li><br>
                </ul>
