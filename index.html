            <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
            <p>Solid-waste management, the collecting, treating, and disposing of solid material that is discarded because it has served its purpose or is no longer useful. Improper disposal of municipal solid waste can create unsanitary conditions, and these conditions in turn can lead to pollution of the environment and to outbreaks of vector-borne disease—that is, diseases spread by rodents and insects. The tasks of solid-waste management present complex technical challenges. They also pose a wide variety of administrative, economic, and social problems that must be managed and solved.</p>

            <h2>Historical Background and Development</h2><br>
            <img src="history_waste.jpg" alt="Historical" height="500px" width="600px"><br><br>
            <p>Waste disposal has evolved from ancient practices of discarding refuse in streets to more organized systems. Early regulations emerged in places like Athens around 320 BCE, while in Rome, property owners managed waste. After the fall of Rome, waste management declined until scavengers were appointed in the 14th century. By the 18th century, municipal collection began in U.S. cities, though methods remained crude. The late 19th century introduced improvements like incinerators, but pollution issues persisted, leading to the development of sanitary landfills in the mid-20th century. Today, modern waste management emphasizes recycling and waste reduction at the source.</p><br>

            <h2>Solid Waste Generation and Composition</h2><br>
            <img src="composition.jpeg" alt="composition" width="600px" height="500px"><br><br>
            <p>Solid waste comes from various sources, including residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial activities, and is categorized into municipal solid waste (MSW), which includes garbage and rubbish, and other types like construction debris and electronic waste. Waste generation rates vary globally, with the U.S. averaging about 2 kg per person per day. Proper storage in durable containers is crucial to prevent pests and odors. Poor waste management can lead to pollution, disease spread, resource depletion, habitat destruction, economic losses, and health risks due to toxic materials. Effective solid waste management is essential to minimize these negative impacts on the environment and public health.</p><br>

            <h2>Solid Waste Collection and Transportation</h2><br>
            <img src="collection.jpeg" alt="collection" height="500px" width="600px"><br><br>
            <p>Proper solid-waste collection is crucial for public health and environmental quality, accounting for about 75% of waste management costs and often requiring complex routing and coordination, especially in densely populated areas. Collection typically occurs weekly to manage rapidly decomposing food waste, with many communities implementing recycling and source separation programs. Challenges include inadequate infrastructure, financial constraints, lack of public awareness, illegal dumping, and operational inefficiencies. Sustainable waste management practices, such as reducing, reusing, recycling, composting, and promoting a circular economy, aim to minimize waste generation, conserve resources, and reduce pollution while creating economic and social benefits.</p><br>

            <h2>Solid Waste Processing and Disposal</h2><br>
            <img src="processing.jpeg" alt="processing" height="500px" width="600px"><br><br>
            <p>Solid-waste treatment and disposal involves various methods to reduce the volume and weight of waste before final disposal. Incineration is effective for volume reduction, capable of decreasing waste by over 90%, while also generating energy in waste-to-energy plants. Composting processes organic waste biologically, producing nutrient-rich compost for soil enhancement. Landfilling remains the most common disposal method, using engineered sanitary landfills to prevent environmental contamination. Recycling separates and recovers valuable materials like paper, metals, and plastics, but challenges include contamination and market limitations. Overall, sustainable waste management incorporates a combination of these practices to minimize environmental impact and conserve resources.</p><br>
