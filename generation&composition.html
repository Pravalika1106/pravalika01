                <h2>Composition and Properties</h2>
                <p>The sources of solid waste include residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial activities. Certain types of wastes that cause immediate danger to exposed individuals or environments are classified as hazardous; these are discussed in the article <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/hazardous-waste-management">hazardous-waste management</a>. All nonhazardous solid waste from a community that requires collection and transport to a processing or disposal site is called <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/refuse-disposal-system">refuse</a> or municipal solid waste (MSW). <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/refuse">Refuse</a> includes garbage and rubbish. Garbage is mostly decomposable food waste; rubbish is mostly dry material such as glass, paper, cloth, or wood. Garbage is highly putrescible or decomposable, whereas rubbish is not. Trash is rubbish that includes bulky items such as old refrigerators, couches, or large tree stumps. Trash requires special collection and handling.</p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/construction-and-demolition-waste">Construction and demolition (C&D)</a> waste (or debris) is a significant component of total solid waste quantities (about 20 percent in the United States), although it is not considered to be part of the MSW stream. However, because C&D waste is inert and nonhazardous, it is usually disposed of in municipal sanitary landfills.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Another type of solid waste, perhaps the fastest-growing component in many developed countries, is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/electronic-waste">electronic waste</a>, or e-waste, which includes discarded computer equipment, televisions, telephones, and a variety of other electronic devices. Concern over this type of waste is escalating. Lead, mercury, and cadmium are among the materials of concern in electronic devices, and governmental policies may be required to regulate their recycling and disposal.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Solid-waste characteristics vary considerably among communities and nations. American refuse is usually lighter, for example, than European or Japanese refuse. In the United States paper and paperboard products make up close to 40 percent of the total weight of MSW; food waste accounts for less than 10 percent. The rest is a mixture of yard trimmings, wood, glass, metal, plastic, leather, cloth, and other miscellaneous materials. In a loose or uncompacted state, MSW of this type weighs approximately 120 kg per cubic metre (200 pounds per cubic yard). These figures vary with geographic location, economic conditions, season of the year, and many other factors. Waste characteristics from each community must be studied carefully before any treatment or disposal facility is designed and built.</p>

                <h2>Generation and Storage</h2>
                <p>Rates of solid-waste generation vary widely. In the United States, for example, municipal refuse is generated at an average rate of approximately 2 kg (4.5 pounds) per person per day. Japan generates roughly half this amount, yet in Canada the rate is 2.7 kg (almost 6 pounds) per person per day. In some developing countries the average rate can be lower than 0.5 kg (1 pound) per person per day. These data include refuse from commercial, institutional, and industrial as well as residential sources. The actual rates of refuse generation must be carefully determined when a community plans a solid-waste management project.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Most communities require household refuse to be stored in durable, easily cleaned containers with tight-fitting covers in order to minimize rodent or insect infestation and offensive odours. Galvanized metal or plastic containers of about 115-litre (30-gallon) capacity are commonly used, although some communities employ larger containers that can be mechanically lifted and emptied into collection trucks. Plastic bags are frequently used as liners or as disposable containers for curbside collection. Where large quantities of refuse are generated—such as at shopping centres, hotels, or apartment buildings—dumpsters may be used for temporary storage until the waste is collected. Some office and commercial buildings use on-site compactors to reduce the waste volume.</p>

                <h2>Environmental and Health Impacts of Solid Waste</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Poor waste management can contaminate soil, water, and air, which can harm ecosystems and human health.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Disease: </strong>Improperly disposed waste can spread diseases through contaminated air and water.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Resource depletion: </strong>Inefficient waste management can lead to the depletion of natural resources. </li><br>
                    <li><strong>Habitat destruction: </strong>Improper waste disposal can destroy habitats and lead to a loss of biodiversity.</li><br> 
                    <li><strong>Economic impact: </strong>Mishandling industrial waste can lead to lost revenue, fines, and other legal consequences. </li><br>
                    <li><strong>Health risks: </strong>Solid waste can contain dangerous toxins and chemicals that can harm people's health. Waste workers are also at risk of injury or death from handling hazardous materials. </li><br>
                    <li><strong>Odor: </strong>As the organic portion of solid waste ferments, it can give off a foul odor that attracts flies. </li><br>
                    <li><strong>Soil degradation: </strong>Dumping solid waste on land can lead to severe degradation of the soil profile. </li><br>
                </ul>
